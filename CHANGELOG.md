# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.4.1] - 2025-11-01 üçÇ

### Changed

- Minor UI tweaks.

### Added

- New **Transparent background** option, replacing the previous **Dark (black background)** theme, to enable transparent background for both dark and light themes. Useful for OLED displays or custom dashboards.

## [0.4.0] - 2025-10-31 üßõüèª

### Added

- **Custom entity support**: Configure Tibber Graph to read price data from any Home Assistant sensor entity (instead of the Tibber integration). The entity must have either a `prices` or `data` attribute containing a list of prices with `start_time`|`start`|`startsAt` and `price`|`price_per_kwh`|`total` fields - see [README.md](README.md#custom-data-source) for examples. The price data source is selected during setup and cannot be changed after creation.

### Changed

- **Tibber integration is now optional**: If not using a custom entity, the Tibber integration must be configured before setting up Tibber Graph.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-10-30 üéÉ

### Added

- **Multiple entity support**: Create multiple independent Tibber Graph camera entities, each with its own configuration
- New `entity_name` configuration option to customize the name of each entity

### Changed

- **Default behavior**: By default, the graph now displays a dotted horizontal line, the price line colors dynamically based on average price, and the current price label appears centered at the top. To restore the previous default behavior; disable **Show average price line**, **Color price line by average**, and **Show current price at top** in the options. To go back to the previous default canvas size, set **Canvas width** to `1200` and **Canvas height** to `700`.

## [0.2.1] - 2025-10-23

### Added

- New **Hours to show** option to limit the number of hours displayed on the graph. When set, the graph shows from the start time (midnight or current hour, depending on the **Start graph at** setting) up to the specified number of hours or the last available data point, whichever comes first.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-20

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Removed support for legacy YAML configuration. The component now requires configuration through the UI (**Settings ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí Add Integration ‚Üí Tibber Graph**). Existing YAML configurations must be migrated to config flow entries.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-17

### Added

- Initial implementation of Tibber Graph camera component
